When called, the `completer` function is provided the current line entered by
the user, and is expected to return an Array with 2 entries:

* An Array with matching entries for the completion.
* The substring that was used for the matching.

For instance: `[[substr1, substr2, ...], originalsubstring]`.

```js
function completer(line) {
  const completions = '.help .error .exit .quit .q'.split(' ');
  const hits = completions.filter((c) => { return c.indexOf(line) === 0 });
  // show all completions if none found
  return [hits.length ? hits : completions, line];
}
```

The `completer` function can be called asynchronously if it accepts two
arguments:

```js
function completer(linePartial, callback) {
  callback(null, [['123'], linePartial]);
}
```
