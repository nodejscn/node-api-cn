* `str` {String}

The `querystring.escape()` method performs URL percent-encoding on the given
`str` in a manner that is optimized for the specific requirements of URL
query strings.

The `querystring.escape()` method is used by `querystring.stringify()` and is
generally not expected to be used directly. It is exported primarily to allow
application code to provide a replacement percent-encoding implementation if
necessary by assigning `querystring.escape` to an alternative function.
