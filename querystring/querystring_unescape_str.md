* `str` {String}


The `querystring.unescape()` method performs decoding of URL percent-encoded
characters on the given `str`.

The `querystring.unescape()` method is used by `querystring.parse()` and is
generally not expected to be used directly. It is exported primarily to allow
application code to provide a replacement decoding implementation if
necessary by assigning `querystring.unescape` to an alternative function.

By default, the `querystring.unescape()` method will attempt to use the
JavaScript built-in `decodeURIComponent()` method to decode. If that fails,
a safer equivalent that does not throw on malformed URLs will be used.
