* `path` {string|Buffer|URL}
* `atime` {number|string|Date}
* `mtime` {number|string|Date}
* `callback` {Function}
  * `err` {Error}

Changes the access and modification times of a file in the same way as
[`fs.utimes()`][], with the difference that if the path refers to a symbolic
link, then the link is not dereferenced: instead, the timestamps of the
symbolic link itself are changed.

No arguments other than a possible exception are given to the completion
callback.
