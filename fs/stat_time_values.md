The times in the stat object have the following semantics:

* `atime` "Access Time" - Time when file data last accessed.  Changed
  by the mknod(2), utimes(2), and read(2) system calls.
* `mtime` "Modified Time" - Time when file data last modified.
  Changed by the mknod(2), utimes(2), and write(2) system calls.
* `ctime` "Change Time" - Time when file status was last changed
  (inode data modification).  Changed by the chmod(2), chown(2),
  link(2), mknod(2), rename(2), unlink(2), utimes(2),
  read(2), and write(2) system calls.
* `birthtime` "Birth Time" -  Time of file creation. Set once when the
  file is created.  On filesystems where birthtime is not available,
  this field may instead hold either the `ctime` or
  `1970-01-01T00:00Z` (ie, unix epoch timestamp `0`). Note that this
  value may be greater than `atime` or `mtime` in this case. On Darwin
  and other FreeBSD variants, also set if the `atime` is explicitly
  set to an earlier value than the current `birthtime` using the
  utimes(2) system call.

Prior to Node v0.12, the `ctime` held the `birthtime` on Windows
systems.  Note that as of v0.12, `ctime` is not "creation time", and
on Unix systems, it never was.
