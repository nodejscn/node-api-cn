Objects returned from [`fs.stat()`][], [`fs.lstat()`][] and [`fs.fstat()`][] and their
synchronous counterparts are of this type.

 - `stats.isFile()`
 - `stats.isDirectory()`
 - `stats.isBlockDevice()`
 - `stats.isCharacterDevice()`
 - `stats.isSymbolicLink()` (only valid with [`fs.lstat()`][])
 - `stats.isFIFO()`
 - `stats.isSocket()`

For a regular file [`util.inspect(stats)`][] would return a string very
similar to this:

```js
{
  dev: 2114,
  ino: 48064969,
  mode: 33188,
  nlink: 1,
  uid: 85,
  gid: 100,
  rdev: 0,
  size: 527,
  blksize: 4096,
  blocks: 8,
  atime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
  mtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
  ctime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT,
  birthtime: Mon, 10 Oct 2011 23:24:11 GMT
}
```

Please note that `atime`, `mtime`, `birthtime`, and `ctime` are
instances of [`Date`][MDN-Date] object and to compare the values of
these objects you should use appropriate methods. For most general
uses [`getTime()`][MDN-Date-getTime] will return the number of
milliseconds elapsed since _1 January 1970 00:00:00 UTC_ and this
integer should be sufficient for any comparison, however there are
additional methods which can be used for displaying fuzzy information.
More details can be found in the [MDN JavaScript Reference][MDN-Date]
page.
