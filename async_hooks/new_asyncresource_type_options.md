* `type` {string} The type of async event.
* `options` {Object}
  * `triggerAsyncId` {number} The ID of the execution context that created this
    async event. **Default:** `executionAsyncId()`.
  * `requireManualDestroy` {boolean} If set to `true`, disables `emitDestroy`
    when the object is garbage collected. This usually does not need to be set
    (even if `emitDestroy` is called manually), unless the resource's `asyncId`
    is retrieved and the sensitive API's `emitDestroy` is called with it.
    When set to `false`, the `emitDestroy` call on garbage collection
    will only take place if there is at least one active `destroy` hook.
    **Default:** `false`.

Example usage:

```js
class DBQuery extends AsyncResource {
  constructor(db) {
    super('DBQuery');
    this.db = db;
  }

  getInfo(query, callback) {
    this.db.get(query, (err, data) => {
      this.runInAsyncScope(callback, null, err, data);
    });
  }

  close() {
    this.db = null;
    this.emitDestroy();
  }
}
```
