    description: Renamed from `currentId`.
-->

* Returns: {number} The `asyncId` of the current execution context. Useful to
  track when something calls.

```js
const async_hooks = require('async_hooks');

console.log(async_hooks.executionAsyncId());  // 1 - bootstrap
fs.open(path, 'r', (err, fd) => {
  console.log(async_hooks.executionAsyncId());  // 6 - open()
});
```

The ID returned from `executionAsyncId()` is related to execution timing, not
causality (which is covered by `triggerAsyncId()`):

```js
const server = net.createServer((conn) => {
  // Returns the ID of the server, not of the new connection, because the
  // callback runs in the execution scope of the server's MakeCallback().
  async_hooks.executionAsyncId();

}).listen(port, () => {
  // Returns the ID of a TickObject (i.e. process.nextTick()) because all
  // callbacks passed to .listen() are wrapped in a nextTick().
  async_hooks.executionAsyncId();
});
```

Promise contexts may not get precise `executionAsyncIds` by default.
See the section on [promise execution tracking][].
