* `list` {Array} List of `Buffer` instances to concat
* `totalLength` {Integer} Total length of the `Buffer` instances in `list`
  when concatenated
* Returns: {Buffer}

Returns a new `Buffer` which is the result of concatenating all the `Buffer`
instances in the `list` together.

If the list has no items, or if the `totalLength` is 0, then a new zero-length
`Buffer` is returned.

If `totalLength` is not provided, it is calculated from the `Buffer` instances
in `list`. This however causes an additional loop to be executed in order to
calculate the `totalLength`, so it is faster to provide the length explicitly if
it is already known.

Example: Create a single `Buffer` from a list of three `Buffer` instances

```js
const buf1 = Buffer.alloc(10);
const buf2 = Buffer.alloc(14);
const buf3 = Buffer.alloc(18);
const totalLength = buf1.length + buf2.length + buf3.length;

// Prints: 42
console.log(totalLength);

const bufA = Buffer.concat([buf1, buf2, buf3], totalLength);

// Prints: <Buffer 00 00 00 00 ...>
console.log(bufA);

// Prints: 42
console.log(bufA.length);
```
