The `'abort'` event is emitted when the `abortController.abort()` method
is called. The callback is invoked with a single object argument with a
single `type` property set to `'abort'`:

```js
const ac = new AbortController();

// Use either the onabort property...
ac.signal.onabort = () => console.log('aborted!');

// Or the EventTarget API...
ac.signal.addEventListener('abort', (event) => {
  console.log(event.type);  // Prints 'abort'
}, { once: true });

ac.abort();
```

The `AbortController` with which the `AbortSignal` is associated will only
ever trigger the `'abort'` event once. We recommended that code check
that the `abortSignal.aborted` attribute is `false` before adding an `'abort'`
event listener.

Any event listeners attached to the `AbortSignal` should use the
`{ once: true }` option (or, if using the `EventEmitter` APIs to attach a
listener, use the `once()` method) to ensure that the event listener is
removed as soon as the `'abort'` event is handled. Failure to do so may
result in memory leaks.
