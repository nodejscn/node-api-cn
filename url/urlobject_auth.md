The `auth` property is the username and password portion of the URL, also
referred to as _userinfo_. This string subset follows the `protocol` and
double slashes (if present) and precedes the `host` component, delimited by `@`.
The string is either the username, or it is the username and password separated
by `:`.

For example: `'user:pass'`.
