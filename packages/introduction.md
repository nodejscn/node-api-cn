A package is a folder tree described by a `package.json` file. The package
consists of the folder containing the `package.json` file and all subfolders
until the next folder containing another `package.json` file, or a folder
named `node_modules`.

This page provides guidance for package authors writing `package.json` files
along with a reference for the [`package.json`][] fields defined by Node.js.
