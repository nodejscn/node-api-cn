* Type: {string}

The `"type"` field defines the module format that Node.js uses for all
`.js` files that have that `package.json` file as their nearest parent.

Files ending with `.js` are loaded as ES modules when the nearest parent
`package.json` file contains a top-level field `"type"` with a value of
`"module"`.

The nearest parent `package.json` is defined as the first `package.json` found
when searching in the current folder, that folder’s parent, and so on up
until a node_modules folder or the volume root is reached.

```json
// package.json
{
  "type": "module"
}
```

```bash
# In same folder as preceding package.json
node my-app.js # Runs as ES module
```

If the nearest parent `package.json` lacks a `"type"` field, or contains
`"type": "commonjs"`, `.js` files are treated as [CommonJS][]. If the volume
root is reached and no `package.json` is found, `.js` files are treated as
[CommonJS][].

`import` statements of `.js` files are treated as ES modules if the nearest
parent `package.json` contains `"type": "module"`.

```js
// my-app.js, part of the same example as above
import './startup.js'; // Loaded as ES module because of package.json
```

Regardless of the value of the `"type"` field, `.mjs` files are always treated
as ES modules and `.cjs` files are always treated as CommonJS.
