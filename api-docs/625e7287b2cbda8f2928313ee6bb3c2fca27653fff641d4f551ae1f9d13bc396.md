* `address` {string}
* `port` {number}

Resolves the given `address` and `port` into a hostname and service using
the operating system's underlying `getnameinfo` implementation.

If `address` is not a valid IP address, a `TypeError` will be thrown.
The `port` will be coerced to a number. If it is not a legal port, a `TypeError`
will be thrown.

On error, the `Promise` is rejected with an [`Error`][] object, where `err.code`
is the error code.

```js
const dnsPromises = require('dns').promises;
dnsPromises.lookupService('127.0.0.1', 22).then((result) => {
  console.log(result.hostname, result.service);
  // Prints: localhost ssh
});
```
