* `exception` {Error}
* `socket` {net.Socket}

If a client connection emits an `'error'` event, it will be forwarded here.
Listener of this event is responsible for closing/destroying the underlying
socket. For example, one may wish to more gracefully close the socket with an
HTTP '400 Bad Request' response instead of abruptly severing the connection.

Default behavior is to destroy the socket immediately on malformed request.

`socket` is the [`net.Socket`][] object that the error originated from.

```js
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.end();
});
server.on('clientError', (err, socket) => {
  socket.end('HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request\r\n\r\n');
});
server.listen(8000);
```

When the `'clientError'` event occurs, there is no `request` or `response`
object, so any HTTP response sent, including response headers and payload,
*must* be written directly to the `socket` object. Care must be taken to
ensure the response is a properly formatted HTTP response message.
