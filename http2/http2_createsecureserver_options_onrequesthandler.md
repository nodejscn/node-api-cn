-->

* `options` {Object}
  * `allowHTTP1` {boolean} Incoming client connections that do not support
    HTTP/2 will be downgraded to HTTP/1.x when set to `true`.
    See the [`'unknownProtocol'`][] event. See [ALPN negotiation][].
    **Default:** `false`.
  * `maxDeflateDynamicTableSize` {number} Sets the maximum dynamic table size
    for deflating header fields. **Default:** `4Kib`.
  * `maxSettings` {number} Sets the maximum number of settings entries per
    `SETTINGS` frame. The minimum value allowed is `1`. **Default:** `32`.
  * `maxSessionMemory`{number} Sets the maximum memory that the `Http2Session`
    is permitted to use. The value is expressed in terms of number of megabytes,
    e.g. `1` equal 1 megabyte. The minimum value allowed is `1`. This is a
    credit based limit, existing `Http2Stream`s may cause this
    limit to be exceeded, but new `Http2Stream` instances will be rejected
    while this limit is exceeded. The current number of `Http2Stream` sessions,
    the current memory use of the header compression tables, current data
    queued to be sent, and unacknowledged `PING` and `SETTINGS` frames are all
    counted towards the current limit. **Default:** `10`.
  * `maxHeaderListPairs` {number} Sets the maximum number of header entries.
    This is similar to [`http.Server#maxHeadersCount`][] or
    [`http.ClientRequest#maxHeadersCount`][]. The minimum value is `4`.
    **Default:** `128`.
  * `maxOutstandingPings` {number} Sets the maximum number of outstanding,
    unacknowledged pings. **Default:** `10`.
  * `maxSendHeaderBlockLength` {number} Sets the maximum allowed size for a
    serialized, compressed block of headers. Attempts to send headers that
    exceed this limit will result in a `'frameError'` event being emitted
    and the stream being closed and destroyed.
  * `paddingStrategy` {number} Strategy used for determining the amount of
    padding to use for `HEADERS` and `DATA` frames. **Default:**
    `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_NONE`. Value may be one of:
    * `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_NONE`: No padding is applied.
    * `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_MAX`: The maximum amount of padding,
      determined by the internal implementation, is applied.
    * `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_ALIGNED`: Attempts to apply enough
      padding to ensure that the total frame length, including the
      9-byte header, is a multiple of 8. For each frame, there is a maximum
      allowed number of padding bytes that is determined by current flow control
      state and settings. If this maximum is less than the calculated amount
      needed to ensure alignment, the maximum is used and the total frame length
      is not necessarily aligned at 8 bytes.
  * `peerMaxConcurrentStreams` {number} Sets the maximum number of concurrent
    streams for the remote peer as if a `SETTINGS` frame had been received. Will
    be overridden if the remote peer sets its own value for
    `maxConcurrentStreams`. **Default:** `100`.
  * `maxSessionInvalidFrames` {integer} Sets the maximum number of invalid
    frames that will be tolerated before the session is closed.
    **Default:** `1000`.
  * `maxSessionRejectedStreams` {integer} Sets the maximum number of rejected
    upon creation streams that will be tolerated before the session is closed.
    Each rejection is associated with an `NGHTTP2_ENHANCE_YOUR_CALM`
    error that should tell the peer to not open any more streams, continuing
    to open streams is therefore regarded as a sign of a misbehaving peer.
    **Default:** `100`.
  * `settings` {HTTP/2 Settings Object} The initial settings to send to the
    remote peer upon connection.
  * ...: Any [`tls.createServer()`][] options can be provided. For
    servers, the identity options (`pfx` or `key`/`cert`) are usually required.
  * `origins` {string[]} An array of origin strings to send within an `ORIGIN`
    frame immediately following creation of a new server `Http2Session`.
* `onRequestHandler` {Function} See [Compatibility API][]
* Returns: {Http2SecureServer}

Returns a `tls.Server` instance that creates and manages `Http2Session`
instances.

```js
const http2 = require('http2');
const fs = require('fs');

const options = {
  key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
  cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

// Create a secure HTTP/2 server
const server = http2.createSecureServer(options);

server.on('stream', (stream, headers) => {
  stream.respond({
    'content-type': 'text/html; charset=utf-8',
    ':status': 200
  });
  stream.end('<h1>Hello World</h1>');
});

server.listen(80);
