-->

* `authority` {string|URL} The remote HTTP/2 server to connect to. This must
  be in the form of a minimal, valid URL with the `http://` or `https://`
  prefix, host name, and IP port (if a non-default port is used). Userinfo
  (user ID and password), path, querystring, and fragment details in the
  URL will be ignored.
* `options` {Object}
  * `maxDeflateDynamicTableSize` {number} Sets the maximum dynamic table size
    for deflating header fields. **Default:** `4Kib`.
  * `maxSettings` {number} Sets the maximum number of settings entries per
    `SETTINGS` frame. The minimum value allowed is `1`. **Default:** `32`.
  * `maxSessionMemory`{number} Sets the maximum memory that the `Http2Session`
    is permitted to use. The value is expressed in terms of number of megabytes,
    e.g. `1` equal 1 megabyte. The minimum value allowed is `1`.
    This is a credit based limit, existing `Http2Stream`s may cause this
    limit to be exceeded, but new `Http2Stream` instances will be rejected
    while this limit is exceeded. The current number of `Http2Stream` sessions,
    the current memory use of the header compression tables, current data
    queued to be sent, and unacknowledged `PING` and `SETTINGS` frames are all
    counted towards the current limit. **Default:** `10`.
  * `maxHeaderListPairs` {number} Sets the maximum number of header entries.
    The minimum value is `1`. **Default:** `128`.
  * `maxOutstandingPings` {number} Sets the maximum number of outstanding,
    unacknowledged pings. **Default:** `10`.
  * `maxReservedRemoteStreams` {number} Sets the maximum number of reserved push
    streams the client will accept at any given time. Once the current number of
    currently reserved push streams exceeds reaches this limit, new push streams
    sent by the server will be automatically rejected. The minimum allowed value
    is 0. The maximum allowed value is 2<sup>32</sup>-1. A negative value sets
    this option to the maximum allowed value. **Default:** `200`.
  * `maxSendHeaderBlockLength` {number} Sets the maximum allowed size for a
    serialized, compressed block of headers. Attempts to send headers that
    exceed this limit will result in a `'frameError'` event being emitted
    and the stream being closed and destroyed.
  * `paddingStrategy` {number} Strategy used for determining the amount of
    padding to use for `HEADERS` and `DATA` frames. **Default:**
    `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_NONE`. Value may be one of:
    * `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_NONE`: No padding is applied.
    * `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_MAX`: The maximum amount of padding,
      determined by the internal implementation, is applied.
    * `http2.constants.PADDING_STRATEGY_ALIGNED`: Attempts to apply enough
      padding to ensure that the total frame length, including the
      9-byte header, is a multiple of 8. For each frame, there is a maximum
      allowed number of padding bytes that is determined by current flow control
      state and settings. If this maximum is less than the calculated amount
      needed to ensure alignment, the maximum is used and the total frame length
      is not necessarily aligned at 8 bytes.
  * `peerMaxConcurrentStreams` {number} Sets the maximum number of concurrent
    streams for the remote peer as if a `SETTINGS` frame had been received. Will
    be overridden if the remote peer sets its own value for
    `maxConcurrentStreams`. **Default:** `100`.
  * `protocol` {string} The protocol to connect with, if not set in the
    `authority`. Value may be either `'http:'` or `'https:'`. **Default:**
    `'https:'`
  * `settings` {HTTP/2 Settings Object} The initial settings to send to the
    remote peer upon connection.
  * `createConnection` {Function} An optional callback that receives the `URL`
    instance passed to `connect` and the `options` object, and returns any
    [`Duplex`][] stream that is to be used as the connection for this session.
  * ...: Any [`net.connect()`][] or [`tls.connect()`][] options can be provided.
* `listener` {Function} Will be registered as a one-time listener of the
  [`'connect'`][] event.
* Returns: {ClientHttp2Session}

Returns a `ClientHttp2Session` instance.

```js
const http2 = require('http2');
const client = http2.connect('https://localhost:1234');

/* Use the client */

client.close();
```
