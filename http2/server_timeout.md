    description: The default timeout changed from 120s to 0 (no timeout).
-->

* {number} Timeout in milliseconds. **Default:** 0 (no timeout)

The number of milliseconds of inactivity before a socket is presumed
to have timed out.

A value of `0` will disable the timeout behavior on incoming connections.

The socket timeout logic is set up on connection, so changing this
value only affects new connections to the server, not any existing connections.
