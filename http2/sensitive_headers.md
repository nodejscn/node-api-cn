HTTP2 headers can be marked as sensitive, which means that the HTTP/2
header compression algorithm will never index them. This can make sense for
header values with low entropy and that may be considered valuable to an
attacker, for example `Cookie` or `Authorization`. To achieve this, add
the header name to the `[http2.sensitiveHeaders]` property as an array:

```js
const headers = {
  ':status': '200',
  'content-type': 'text-plain',
  'cookie': 'some-cookie',
  'other-sensitive-header': 'very secret data',
  [http2.sensitiveHeaders]: ['cookie', 'other-sensitive-header']
};

stream.respond(headers);
```

For some headers, such as `Authorization` and short `Cookie` headers,
this flag is set automatically.

This property is also set for received headers. It will contain the names of
all headers marked as sensitive, including ones marked that way automatically.
