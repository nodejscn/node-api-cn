These functions are implemented quite differently than [`dns.lookup()`][]. They
do not use getaddrinfo(3) and they _always_ perform a DNS query on the
network. This network communication is always done asynchronously, and does not
use libuv's threadpool.

As a result, these functions cannot have the same negative impact on other
processing that happens on libuv's threadpool that [`dns.lookup()`][] can have.

They do not use the same set of configuration files than what [`dns.lookup()`][]
uses. For instance, _they do not use the configuration from `/etc/hosts`_.
