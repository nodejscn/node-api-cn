- `hostname` {string} Hostname to resolve.
- `options` {Object}
  - `ttl` {boolean} Retrieve the Time-To-Live value (TTL) of each record.
    When `true`, the `Promise` is resolved with an array of
    `{ address: '1.2.3.4', ttl: 60 }` objects rather than an array of strings,
    with the TTL expressed in seconds.

Uses the DNS protocol to resolve IPv4 addresses (`A` records) for the
`hostname`. On success, the `Promise` is resolved with an array of IPv4
addresses (e.g. `['74.125.79.104', '74.125.79.105', '74.125.79.106']`).
