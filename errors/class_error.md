<!--type=class-->

A generic JavaScript `Error` object that does not denote any specific
circumstance of why the error occurred. `Error` objects capture a "stack trace"
detailing the point in the code at which the `Error` was instantiated, and may
provide a text description of the error.

All errors generated by Node.js, including all System and JavaScript errors,
will either be instances of, or inherit from, the `Error` class.
