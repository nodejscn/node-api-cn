Type: Documentation-only

[`response.finished`][] indicates whether [`response.end()`][] has been
called, not whether `'finish'` has been emitted and the underlying data
is flushed.

Use [`response.writableFinished`][] or [`response.writableEnded`][]
accordingly instead to avoid the ambigiuty.

To maintain existing behaviour `response.finished` should be replaced with
`response.writableEnded`.
