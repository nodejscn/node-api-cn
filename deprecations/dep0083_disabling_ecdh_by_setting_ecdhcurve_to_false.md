Type: End-of-Life.

The `ecdhCurve` option to `tls.createSecureContext()` and `tls.TLSSocket` could
be set to `false` to disable ECDH entirely on the server only. This mode was
deprecated in preparation for migrating to OpenSSL 1.1.0 and consistency with
the client and is now unsupported. Use the `ciphers` parameter instead.
