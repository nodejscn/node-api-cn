Type: End-of-Life

Since Node.js versions 4.4.0 and 5.2.0, several modules only intended for
internal usage were mistakenly exposed to user code through `require()`. These
modules were:

* `v8/tools/codemap`
* `v8/tools/consarray`
* `v8/tools/csvparser`
* `v8/tools/logreader`
* `v8/tools/profile_view`
* `v8/tools/profile`
* `v8/tools/SourceMap`
* `v8/tools/splaytree`
* `v8/tools/tickprocessor-driver`
* `v8/tools/tickprocessor`
* `node-inspect/lib/_inspect` (from 7.6.0)
* `node-inspect/lib/internal/inspect_client` (from 7.6.0)
* `node-inspect/lib/internal/inspect_repl` (from 7.6.0)

The `v8/*` modules do not have any exports, and if not imported in a specific
order would in fact throw errors. As such there are virtually no legitimate use
cases for importing them through `require()`.

On the other hand, `node-inspect` can be installed locally through a package
manager, as it is published on the npm registry under the same name. No source
code modification is necessary if that is done.
