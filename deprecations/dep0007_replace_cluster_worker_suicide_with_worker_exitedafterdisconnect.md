Type: End-of-Life

In an earlier version of the Node.js `cluster`, a boolean property with the name
`suicide` was added to the `Worker` object. The intent of this property was to
provide an indication of how and why the `Worker` instance exited. In Node.js
6.0.0, the old property was deprecated and replaced with a new
[`worker.exitedAfterDisconnect`][] property. The old property name did not
precisely describe the actual semantics and was unnecessarily emotion-laden.
