The `writable.uncork()` method flushes all data buffered since
[`stream.cork()`][] was called.

When using `writable.cork()` and `writable.uncork()` to manage the buffering
of writes to a stream, it is recommended that calls to `writable.uncork()` be
deferred using `process.nextTick()`. Doing so allows batching of all
`writable.write()` calls that occur within a given Node.js event loop phase.

```js
stream.cork();
stream.write('some ');
stream.write('data ');
process.nextTick(() => stream.uncork());
```

If the `writable.cork()` method is called multiple times on a stream, the same
number of calls to `writable.uncork()` must be called to flush the buffered
data.

```js
stream.cork();
stream.write('some ');
stream.cork();
stream.write('data ');
process.nextTick(() => {
  stream.uncork();
  // The data will not be flushed until uncork() is called a second time.
  stream.uncork();
});
```
