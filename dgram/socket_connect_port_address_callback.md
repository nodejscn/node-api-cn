* `port` {integer}
* `address` {string}
* `callback` {Function} Called when the connection is completed or on error.

Associates the `dgram.Socket` to a remote address and port. Every
message sent by this handle is automatically sent to that destination. Also,
the socket will only receive messages from that remote peer.
Trying to call `connect()` on an already connected socket will result
in an [`ERR_SOCKET_DGRAM_IS_CONNECTED`][] exception. If `address` is not
provided, `'127.0.0.1'` (for `udp4` sockets) or `'::1'` (for `udp6` sockets)
will be used by default. Once the connection is complete, a `'connect'` event
is emitted and the optional `callback` function is called. In case of failure,
the `callback` is called or, failing this, an `'error'` event is emitted.
