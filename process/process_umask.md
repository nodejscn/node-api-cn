    description: Calling `process.umask()` with no arguments is deprecated.

-->

> Stability: 0 - Deprecated. Calling `process.umask()` with no argument causes

> cross-platform alternative API.

`process.umask()` returns the Node.js process's file mode creation mask. Child
processes inherit the mask from the parent process.
