* `line` {Buffer} Line of ASCII text, in NSS `SSLKEYLOGFILE` format.
* `tlsSocket` {tls.TLSSocket} The `tls.TLSSocket` instance on which it was
  generated.

The `keylog` event is emitted when key material is generated or received by
a connection to this server (typically before handshake has completed, but not
necessarily). This keying material can be stored for debugging, as it allows
captured TLS traffic to be decrypted. It may be emitted multiple times for
each socket.

A typical use case is to append received lines to a common text file, which
is later used by software (such as Wireshark) to decrypt the traffic:

```js
const logFile = fs.createWriteStream('/tmp/ssl-keys.log', { flags: 'a' });
// ...
server.on('keylog', (line, tlsSocket) => {
  if (tlsSocket.remoteAddress !== '...')
    return; // Only log keys for a particular IP
  logFile.write(line);
});
```
