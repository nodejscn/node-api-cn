The goal of this documentation is to comprehensively explain the Node.js
API, both from a reference as well as a conceptual point of view.  Each
section describes a built-in module or high-level concept.

Where appropriate, property types, method arguments, and the arguments
provided to event handlers are detailed in a list underneath the topic
heading.

Every `.html` document has a corresponding `.json` document presenting
the same information in a structured manner.  This feature is
experimental, and added for the benefit of IDEs and other utilities that
wish to do programmatic things with the documentation.

Every `.html` and `.json` file is generated based on the corresponding
`.md` file in the `doc/api/` folder in Node.js's source tree.  The
documentation is generated using the `tools/doc/generate.js` program.
The HTML template is located at `doc/template.html`.
