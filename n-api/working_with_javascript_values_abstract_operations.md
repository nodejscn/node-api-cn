N-API exposes a set of APIs to perform some abstract operations on JavaScript
values. Some of these operations are documented under

of the [ECMAScript Language Specification][].

These APIs support doing one of the following:
1. Coerce JavaScript values to specific JavaScript types (such as `Number` or
   `String`).
2. Check the type of a JavaScript value.
3. Check for equality between two JavaScript values.
