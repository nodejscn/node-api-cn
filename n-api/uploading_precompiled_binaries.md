The three tools listed here permit native addon developers and maintainers
to create and upload binaries to public or private servers. These tools are
typically integrated with CI/CD build systems like [Travis CI][] and
[AppVeyor][] to build and upload binaries for a variety of platforms and
architectures. These binaries are then available for download by users who
do not need to have a C/C++ toolchain installed.
