**Strict assertion mode**

An alias of [`assert.deepStrictEqual()`][].

**Legacy assertion mode**

> Stability: 3 - Legacy: Use [`assert.deepStrictEqual()`][] instead.

Tests for deep equality between the `actual` and `expected` parameters. Consider
using [`assert.deepStrictEqual()`][] instead. [`assert.deepEqual()`][] can have
surprising results.

_Deep equality_ means that the enumerable "own" properties of child objects
are also recursively evaluated by the following rules.
