    description: The default encoding for `password` if it is a string changed
                 from `binary` to `utf8`.
-->
* `password` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* `salt` {string|Buffer|TypedArray|DataView}
* `iterations` {number}
* `keylen` {number}
* `digest` {string}
* `callback` {Function}
  - `err` {Error}
  - `derivedKey` {Buffer}

Provides an asynchronous Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2)
implementation. A selected HMAC digest algorithm specified by `digest` is
applied to derive a key of the requested byte length (`keylen`) from the
`password`, `salt` and `iterations`.

The supplied `callback` function is called with two arguments: `err` and
`derivedKey`. If an error occurs while deriving the key, `err` will be set;
otherwise `err` will be `null`. By default, the successfully generated
`derivedKey` will be passed to the callback as a [`Buffer`][]. An error will be
thrown if any of the input arguments specify invalid values or types.

If `digest` is `null`, `'sha1'` will be used. This behavior will be deprecated
in a future version of Node.js.

The `iterations` argument must be a number set as high as possible. The
higher the number of iterations, the more secure the derived key will be,
but will take a longer amount of time to complete.

The `salt` should be as unique as possible. It is recommended that a salt is
random and at least 16 bytes long. See [NIST SP 800-132][] for details.

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
crypto.pbkdf2('secret', 'salt', 100000, 64, 'sha512', (err, derivedKey) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(derivedKey.toString('hex'));  // '3745e48...08d59ae'
});
```

The `crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING` property can be used to change the way the
`derivedKey` is passed to the callback. This property, however, has been
deprecated and use should be avoided.

```js
const crypto = require('crypto');
crypto.DEFAULT_ENCODING = 'hex';
crypto.pbkdf2('secret', 'salt', 100000, 512, 'sha512', (err, derivedKey) => {
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(derivedKey);  // '3745e48...aa39b34'
});
```

An array of supported digest functions can be retrieved using
[`crypto.getHashes()`][].

Note that this API uses libuv's threadpool, which can have surprising and
negative performance implications for some applications, see the
[`UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`][] documentation for more information.
