<!-- YAML
added: v12.16.0
-->

This symbol shall be used to install a listener for only monitoring `'error'`
events. Listeners installed using this symbol are called before the regular
`'error'` listeners are called.

Installing a listener using this symbol does not change the behavior once an
`'error'` event is emitted, therefore the process will still crash if no
regular `'error'` listener is installed.
