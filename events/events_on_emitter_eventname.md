* `emitter` {EventEmitter}
* `eventName` {string|symbol} The name of the event being listened for
* Returns: {AsyncIterator} that iterates `eventName` events emitted by the `emitter`

```js
const { on, EventEmitter } = require('events');

(async () => {
  const ee = new EventEmitter();

  // Emit later on
  process.nextTick(() => {
    ee.emit('foo', 'bar');
    ee.emit('foo', 42);
  });

  for await (const event of on(ee, 'foo')) {
    // The execution of this inner block is synchronous and it
    // processes one event at a time (even with await). Do not use
    // if concurrent execution is required.
    console.log(event); // prints ['bar'] [42]
  }
  // Unreachable here
})();
```

Returns an `AsyncIterator` that iterates `eventName` events. It will throw
if the `EventEmitter` emits `'error'`. It removes all listeners when
exiting the loop. The `value` returned by each iteration is an array
composed of the emitted event arguments.
