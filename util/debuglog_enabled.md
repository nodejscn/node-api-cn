* {boolean}

The `util.debuglog().enabled` getter is used to create a test that can be used
in conditionals based on the existence of the `NODE_DEBUG` environment variable.
If the `section` name appears within the value of that environment variable,
then the returned value will be `true`. If not, then the returned value will be
`false`.

```js
const util = require('util');
const enabled = util.debuglog('foo').enabled;
if (enabled) {
  console.log('hello from foo [%d]', 123);
}
```

If this program is run with `NODE_DEBUG=foo` in the environment, then it will
output something like:

```console
hello from foo [123]
```
